## Welcome to testdodo

You can use this site to learn about testing your software.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.  This site uses 'Just the Docs' to organize its information.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/testdodo/testdodo.github.io/settings/pages). This site uses a remote themd (Just the Docs.)
The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
