## About

You can use this site to learn about building and testing software.

## Getting Started

While there are a lot of good resources on the internet, 
there are also a lot of bad resources on the internet.  
This site is intended to make sure you do it correctly.

## Notes
-This project was started as test on 19-Aug-2021.  
-It will eventually move to its own home.
-Notes accompany each section based on teachings in modern CS curricula.  
-You can pay for a degree but you probably don't have to.
